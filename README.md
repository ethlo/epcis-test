GS1 EPCIS acceptance test
=========================

As there is no reference implementation or any available acceptance tests for GS1 EPCIS implemenations, this is an attempt to create a test suite that can easily be run against any implementation of EPCIS, ensuring at least a minimum of compatibility. 

For full EPCIS certification one need to pay GS1 for the certification process. 

Limitations:
============
Currently it depends on running the tests embedded using various adapters. The end-goal is to have a test case that can do black-box testing using only the defined EPCIS end-points.

The test data was taken from [https://code.google.com/p/fosstrak/]FossTrak (An open source EPCIS implementation).
